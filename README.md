# SQL_With_Python
Python command for data insertion into the DataBase, MySQL script, and another IPYNB file for visualization which also contains the sql command in python


## What assumptions about the data did you make when creating your retention charts?
I have assumed and understood that there have been new customers in the following months. For example, customer with user_id: 1396843 is a new entry in the 'purchases.csv' file while it was not in the 'first_purchases.csv' file. Therefore, I treated them while conducting my MySQL quarries.

## Did you encounter any problems in the data?
It was little bit tricky to upload the csv files as I did it with python coding. However, I prepared the data accordingly. Otherwise, I consider it has been a great learning for me while doing the assignment.

## Which additional data sources or business information do you think could be used to improve your solution?
Based on the questions asked, I can say that there has been sufficient information.


# NB: Please, note that I did not learn it in my university, rather I learnt it by myself.
